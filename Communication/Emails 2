Hi Mike,

This is Izz from the Web Team,
Question 1: Yes you are correct, it is a different product that is being used than the one in the link.
Dynoraxx uses site builder which does not support responsive design, but suite eCommerce advance does.
Having a different product features on a separate domain name does solve the issue, but the cart will still be unresponsive because it will still be using the site builder cart.


For question 2, we can't be 100% sure what is cause of the issue without a login to investigate.
However, I can offer a list of the most common issues which prevents items from appearing on the store.

1- Display item on web store check box,
	Navigation:
	Go to: List>Web Site>items
	Click edit on the item is required to be displayed
	Go to Web store Tab
	Check Display In Web Store check box
	
2- Pricing, the item will not appear if the pricing is not set.
	Navigation:
	Go to: Sales/ Pricing Tab on the item page.
	Make sure a price is set for the item.
	
3- Category, Make sure that items are classified under a specific category.
	Navigation:
	Go to: List>Web Site>Categories

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
