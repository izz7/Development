Hello Ron,

The issue here is that the shipping estimator is only an estimator.
The cart estimator works by a simple method to give an approximate price, it basically calculates and gives a price based from a commercial zip code and the lowest priced shipping method available, not taking into account any specific shipping rules.

However, the checkout component does a different and more accurate calculation. The checkout considers all the proper variables (e.g. real address, weight, etc.).

The estimator behavior is a known factor, many other customers share the same frustration with this component.

After reproducing the scenario,note that if you click the estimate button again, the estimator will re-estimate accordingly to the current list in the cart,which handles the case where items are removed from the order

If the current behavior is not acceptable to you, there are a few possible solutions:
1)We can remove the estimator to avoid confusion for the users.
2)We can look into forcing the estimate button to be automatically clicked to re-estimate on page load.
3)We look into implementing a custom estimator solution that would be closer to the checkout page.

In addition we can mention this defect to NetSuite which may help its priority in being resolved by NetSuite as it has been request before.

Please contact me by phone or email for any further details.

Regards,
